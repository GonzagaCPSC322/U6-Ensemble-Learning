    "Basic Idea\n",
    "* Different (individual) classifiers have strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "* Instead of using just one, apply multiple (different) classifiers\n",
    "* Use voting to select prediction\n",
    "* Can lead to better prediction results\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "* Entropy tends to result in smaller decision trees\n",
    "* Which often lead to \"better\" predictions ... but not guaranteed\n",
    "* Instead use different attribute selection approaches, and choose \"most popular\" prediction (among the ensemble)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "Types of classification used\n",
    "* If same type (e.g., decision trees), ensemble is **homogeneous** (our focus)\n",
    "* If different types, the ensemble is **heterogeneous**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to generate many (e.g., 100s of) classifiers from data... either use all or select some for creating the ensemble\n",

    "### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)\n",
    "Recall: Bootstrap method performs sampling with replacement\n",
    "* Given a dataset $D$ of size $|D|$ instances\n",
    "* Randomly select $|D|$ instances with replacement\n",
    "* Results in a training set approximately 63% the size of $|D|$ and a test set 36% the size of $|D|$\n",
    "* Training set will (likely) have duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Idea\n",
    "* Generate $k$ classifiers\n",
    "* Each classifier $M_i$ is trained on $D_i$ (for $1 \\leq i \\leq k$)\n",
    "* Where $D_i$ is a bootstrap sample\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify an instance $X$:\n",
    "* Run each classifier Mi on X to get predicted label $L_i$\n",
    "* Each label $L_i$ is a vote for that label\n",

    "Write a bootstrap function to return a random sample of rows with\n",
    "replacement:\n",

    "* [`np.random.randint(low, high)`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.randint.html) returns $n$ such that $low \\leq n < high$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that instead of using bootstrapping for testing ...\n",
    "* We are using it here to **create** the ensemble for prediction\n",
    "* i.e., our classifier = set of classifiers over subsamples of original dataset\n",

    "1. Divide $D$ into a test and remainder set\n",
    "    * Take 1/3 for test set, 2/3 for remainder set\n",
